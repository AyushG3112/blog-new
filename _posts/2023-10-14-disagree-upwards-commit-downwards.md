If you've been in the industry for a while, you've likely encountered the phrase "disagree and commit."

This means means that when a decision is being made, everyone is free to express their disagreement. However, once a consensus has been reached and the decision is finalized, it's essential for everyone to commit to it and ensure its successful execution.

This principle stands as one of the foundational leadership tenets and acts as a cornerstone to foster organizational unity and efficient execution.

Today, however, I'd like to introduce a term I recently came across: "disagree upwards, commit downwards."

Whether we like it or not, we won't be part of every decision-making process. Some decisions are made at higher levels — by managers, skip managers, CXOs, founders, boards of directors, shareholders etc— and then passed down to us for execution.

You might not agree with a decision or have concerns about it. Nonetheless, such reservations should be communicated primarily upwards to the leadership and, if necessary, among peers. They shouldn't trickle down to those below unless it's crucial for efficient planning and execution.

When you're in the leadership position, you represent the vision of the organization to the people you're overseeing. As such, it's important to present a unified front of the organization's vision to those you oversee. This helps avoid confusion, aligns everyone with the organizational objectives, and streamlines execution.

And always remember to be situationally aware and respectful. When you talk to anyone — whether they're your superiors, juniors, or peers — keep in mind that they are real people with genuine feelings and egos. Understanding how to communicate and voice your thoughts is crucial.

With this in mind, I wish you luck in navigating the puzzle that is the organization.
